Each binary, when run, will ask for a password, which can be entered via stdin
(typing it into the console.) 

Your goal is to find a single password that works for each binary.

If you enter an incorrect password, the program will print "Try again." If you
enter a correct password, the program will print "Good Job."

Each challenge will be accompanied by a file. It will offer guidance as well as the skeleton of a possible
solution. You will have to edit each file. While use of these files is recommended, you can write
a solution without them, if you find that they are too restrictive.

Places in the file that require a simple substitution will be marked
with three question marks (???). Places that require more code will be marked
with an ellipsis (...). Comments will document any new concepts. If a
comment documents a part of the code that needs to be changed, it will be
marked with an exclamation point at the end, on a separate line (!).
